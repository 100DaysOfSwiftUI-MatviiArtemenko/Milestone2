From *[100DaysOfSwiftUI :](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui "Hacking with Swift")*
> *Your goal is to build an “edutainment” app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – “what is 7 x 8?” and so on. Edutainment apps are educational at their code, but ideally have enough playfulness about them to make kids want to play.</br>*

## &nbsp; 🎖 Challenge
> Breaking it down:
> + The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an “Up to…” stepper, going from 2 to 12..
> + The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, or 20.
> + You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for.
